#summary Instructions on how to build the wxWorkspaceView library

= Building Instructions =

wxWorkspaceView ships with a solution file that can be build using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. On Windows. Other compilers and platforms are currently unsupported.

= Requirements =

The wxWorkspaceView library depends on [http://www.wxwidgets.org wxWidgets 2.8]. But it might also build with wxWidgets 2.6, although that's completely unsupported. 

The project file is configuration to look for wxWidgets in "../wxWidgets-2.8.0". So you either have to place wxWidgets there, or add wxWidgets' header and lib paths to your Visual Studio's search paths.
